### Hello I'm Sandra Nguyen ðŸ’—

A Fall 2024 grad & Computer Science major at [California State University, Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/), with experience in data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to building my technical skills by engaging with faculty-led research and building exploratory software projects that aim to challenge the issues of today.

As an Asian American woman in tech, I am a firm believer in organizations like [WiCSE](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/wicse/) whose purpose is to support underrepresented groups and using my leadership roles to encourage my peers to transcend societal barriers.

A heartfelt thanks to my professors and peers for making my time in undergrad truly memorable.

Now a full-time Information Security Engineer @ [Reddit](https://redditinc.com/careers), I am excited by the challenges of safeguarding our online communities and enhancing cybersecurity measures. Looking ahead, I plan to apply to an online Master's program in AI to build a strong theoretical foundation and further my professional growth.
