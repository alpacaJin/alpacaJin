### Hello I'm Sandra Nguyen ðŸ’—

A 3rd-year computer science major at California State University, Fullerton, with experience in data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to building my technical skills by engaging with faculty-led research and building exploratory software projects that aim to challenge the issues of today.

As an Asian American woman in tech, I am a firm believer in organizations whose purpose is to support underrepresented groups and using my leadership roles to encourage my peers to transcend societal barriers.
